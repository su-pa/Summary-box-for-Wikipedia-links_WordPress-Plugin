The «Summary box for Wikipedia links» brings the preview boxes from Wikipedia to your website! 
It displays nice summary boxes on every Wikipedia link.

== Description ==

The **«Summary box for Wikipedia links»** plugin enhances your website by **<u>automatically</u>** turning **all <u>existing</u> and <u>new</u> Wikipedia links** into interactive and informative summary boxes!

**A few years ago, MediaWiki** had the fantastic idea of [**preview boxes**](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Page_Previews) (mediawiki.org), which provides page previews (summaries) for internal Wikipedia links. 

**We thought it would be great to make this feature available to <u>any website or web app</u>!** And to make it work well with **touch and mouse** on **mobile and desktop**.

In **2021** we started a project and released a small **JavaScript library** that **can be used by anyone**, see the [project page](https://su-pa.net/wikiPrevBox/) (su-pa.net). **In the course of an update** and some functional enhancements, we took the opportunity to **create this plugin** for the world's most widely used CMS, WordPress!

**Features**
* It's lightweight, free and open source.
* Activate the plugin to **instantly** display summary boxes on all **<u>existing</u> and <u>new</u> Wikipedia links**.
* Very lightweight and does not affect your website in any way.
* Works flawlessly with touch and mouse on mobile and desktop.
* Fine animation and Wikipedia links are marked with a pretty superscript "Wiki-W" next to the linked term.
* Supports all languages and text directions available on Wikipedia, including in mixed content.
* Link to subsections within Wikipedia articles.
* Customize settings for all or individual summary boxes, show/hide images, width, number of characters, font size, and more.

**Benefits**
* Simplify content creation by offering on-demand term explanations.
* Connect your visitors to Wikipedia's wealth of knowledge.
* Enhances your website with a useful and nice feature!

**Extras**
* The «Summary box for Wikipedia links» can be made available on **any website or web application**, not just WordPress! **It only takes a few minutes and one line of code to have the feature!**  
See the [project page](https://su-pa.net/wikiPrevBox/) for the "how to".
* **Download the plugin as a ZIP file directly** from the [project page](https://su-pa.net/wikiPrevBox/).
* Wikimedia Foundation has also developed a WordPress plugin, [Wikipedia Preview](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wikipedia-preview) with a quiet other approach.  
**You could (dato) use both plugins at the same time** (no conflicts to worry about) and combine the features. **Note:** If you do so you should **not use** the (cool) link selection tool of the Wikmedia plugin, despite **set the links to the Wikipedia articles as you set links normally**. 

**See it in action**
* Example usage on [dontwastemy.energy](https://dontwastemy.energy/2023/05/23/video-games-and-the-environment-how-are-they-related/)
* More examples on our [project page](https://su-pa.net/wikiPrevBox/) (su-pa.net).

**Donate**  
The initial version was created for our project **"The Horse" concept** to support student learning and projects. If you find the plugin helpful, consider supporting the development by donating to [THE ! association](https://the-horse.education).

Not all, but most, Wikipedia articles contain an image that can be displayed in the summary box. Also make sure that you didn't use the "#dontshowimage" parameter in your Wikipedia link.

= How do I customize the settings for the summary boxes? =

In your WordPress admin area, navigate to Settings > **Summary for Wikipedia**. There, you can adjust the width, number of characters, font size, disable showing images in all summary boxes, and more.

= I did a change in the settings but it seems not to have an effect. =
